Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
It enables systems to perform tasks such as reasoning, learning, planning,
and decision-making.

Modern AI involves:
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Deep Learning (DL)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision (CV)
- Large Language Models (LLMs)

AI applications include chatbots, recommendation systems, predictive analytics,
healthcare diagnostics, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles.
