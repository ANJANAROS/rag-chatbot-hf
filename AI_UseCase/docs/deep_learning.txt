Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers.

Key concepts:
- Neural Networks: Layers of interconnected neurons
- Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh
- Loss functions: Cross-entropy, MSE
- Optimizers: Adam, SGD

Popular architectures:
- CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for images
- RNNs / LSTMs for sequences
- Transformers for language

Deep learning frameworks:
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- Keras

Use cases:
- Image recognition
- Speech processing
- Chatbots and LLMs
- Video analytics
