Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data.

Types of ML:
1. Supervised Learning
   - Regression (predicting continuous values)
   - Classification (predicting categories)
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Clustering and grouping similar data
   - Algorithms: K-Means, PCA

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Agent learns actions by receiving rewards or penalties.

Common ML workflow:
- Data collection
- Cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Evaluation and deployment

Popular libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
